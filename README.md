## Why does this package exist:
The purpose of `Metrics` is to provide a one-stop-shop for a variety of functions we might use when assessing
 - Forecasters
 - Financial returns
 - Comparing models

As we uncover more use cases for new metrics, they should be added to this package under a new category if necessary.
